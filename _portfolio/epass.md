### Overview
ePass introduces a lightweight, in-kernel mechanism for eBPF programs, leveraging a compact Intermediate Representation (IR) with 12 built-in passes. It addresses:
- False rejections in eBPF verifier logic.
- Runtime optimization and safety.

### Key Features
- Combines static and runtime verification.
- Enhances flexibility without compromising safety.
- Optimizes bytecode for kernel execution.

### Contribution
Developed as part of my research internship at OrderLab under the supervision of Professor Ryan Peng Huang (University of Michigan). This work is aimed at OSDI.
