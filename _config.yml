          In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach for a 
          trip planner, that finds the most popular multi-modal trip 
          using public transport from historical trips, given a source, 
          a destination, and user-defined constraints such as time, 
          minimum switches, or preferred modes of transport. To solve 
          the most popular trip and its variants, we propose a multi-stage 
          deep learning architecture, PathOracle, that consists of two 
          major components: KSNet to generate key stops, and MPTNet to 
          generate popular path trips from a source to a destination 
          passing through the key stops. We also introduce a unique 
          representation of stops using Stop2Vec that considers both the 
          neighborhood and trip popularity between stops to facilitate 
          accurate path planning. We present an extensive experimental 
          study with a large real-world public transport based commuting 
          Myki dataset of Melbourne city, and demonstrate the effectiveness 
          of our proposed approaches.

          Reconstructing a layout of indoor spaces has been a crucial part of growing 
          indoor location based services. One of the key challenges in the proliferation 
          of indoor location based services is the unavailability of indoor spatial maps 
          due to the complex nature of capturing an indoor space model (e.g., floor plan) 
          of an existing building. In this paper, we propose a system to automatically 
          generate floor plans that can recognize rooms from the point-clouds obtained 
          through smartphones like Google's Tango. In particular, we propose two 
          approaches - a Recurrent Neural Network based approach using Pointer Network 
          and a Convolutional Neural Network based approach using Mask-RCNN to identify 
          rooms (and thereby floor plans) from point-clouds. Experimental results on 
          different datasets demonstrate approximately 0.80-0.90 Intersection-over-Union 
          scores, which show that our models can effectively identify the rooms and regenerate 
          the shapes of the rooms in heterogeneous environment.

          Trajectory User Linking (TUL) is the problem of identifying the user 
          (i.e., his identity) from the trajectories generated by him. 
          Existing works on TUL leverage a single trajectory for identifying a user. 
          We propose a novel problem called Multi-Trajectory User Linking (MTUL), 
          which leverages all available trajectories generated by a particular user 
          to identify him. Thus, MTUL is essentially the generalized TUL problem. 
          This problem has significant applications in Location-Based Services 
          (LBSs) such as personalized route planning and point-of-interests (POI) 
          recommendation, movement anomaly detection, etc. 
          We provide an end-to-end solution to the MTUL problem using 
          sequence embedding and GRU and achieve reasonable accuracy by taking into 
          account the POI type and region information. 
          We consider this work to be an important addition to the TUL research.

          Handwritten digit recognition has been the “hello world” of deep learning. 
          Yet, there are no significant work on Bengali handwritten digits due to a 
          lack of benchmark dataset. NumtaDB is the largest dataset on Bengali handwritten 
          digits and currently we have the best accuracy of 99.3359% on it. We used popular 
          CNN architectures namely, ResNet34 and Resnet50. We preprocessed the data, used data 
          augmentation, and trained our models with augmented data. We tested our models on 
          both the raw test data and cleaned test data. We found that slightly underfitted 
          models work better on the test data. And finally ensembled our six best models to 
          get our final predictions. In this paper we describe some methods and techniques that 
          performs well in NumtaDB dataset.
