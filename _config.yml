  Hi, <b>Quvi</b> here. 
  I am a remote research intern at OrderLab, 
  <a href="https://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a>. 
  My research interests lie in the intersection of Operating Systems, Computer Architecture and Compilers. 
  My current research focuses on reliable kernel extensibility.

            DistilAgent: Distilling Agentic Capabilities from Large Language Models for Long-Horizon UI Navigation
          </b></h4><br>

          <p style="text-align: center">

          <p>
          Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential as autonomous 
          agents in diverse environments, but their agentic capabilities are 
          strongly contingent on their parameter count and context window size. 
          While closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 and Claude are already quite capable, 
          smaller open-source models struggle with autonomous UI navigation tasks. 
          To bridge this gap, we propose DistilAgent, a novel framework that 
          distills the capabilities of long-context closed-source LLMs into smaller models
          , significantly improving their performance in autonomous UI navigation. 
          DistilAgent incorporates three key components: task discretization to 
          break down long-horizon tasks into smaller sub-tasks that fit within the 
          context window of smaller models, explicit reasoning enforcement to ensure 
          the LLM reasons about grounding and the current state of the environment, 
          and exploration encouragement to prompt the LLM to explore the UI when 
          required actions are not immediately available on the current screen. 
          Our results demonstrate that DistilAgent improves the task completion rate 
          of GPT4 from 50% to 90%. We collected AutoNav1K - a synthetic dataset of 
          1,000 GPT4 task executions using DistilAgent. After finetuning on AutoNav1K, 
          the task completion rate of LLaMA-3.1-8B improved from 0% to 60%. DistilAgent 
          showcases the potential for distilling the agentic capabilities of large, 
          closed-source LLMs into smaller models, democratizing access to high-performance 
          autonomous UI navigation.
