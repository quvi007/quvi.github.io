          Trajectory User Linking (TUL) is the problem of identifying the user 
          (i.e., his identity) from the trajectories generated by him. 
          Existing works on TUL leverage a single trajectory for identifying a user. 
          We propose a novel problem called Multi-Trajectory User Linking (MTUL), 
          which leverages all available trajectories generated by a particular user 
          to identify him. Thus, MTUL is essentially the generalized TUL problem. 
          This problem has significant applications in Location-Based Services 
          (LBSs) such as personalized route planning and point-of-interests (POI) 
          recommendation, movement anomaly detection, etc. 
          We provide an end-to-end solution to the MTUL problem using 
          sequence embedding and GRU and achieve reasonable accuracy by taking into 
          account the POI type and region information. 
          We consider this work to be an important addition to the TUL research.

          Handwritten digit recognition has been the “hello world” of deep learning. 
          Yet, there are no significant work on Bengali handwritten digits due to a 
          lack of benchmark dataset. NumtaDB is the largest dataset on Bengali handwritten 
          digits and currently we have the best accuracy of 99.3359% on it. We used popular 
          CNN architectures namely, ResNet34 and Resnet50. We preprocessed the data, used data 
          augmentation, and trained our models with augmented data. We tested our models on 
          both the raw test data and cleaned test data. We found that slightly underfitted 
          models work better on the test data. And finally ensembled our six best models to 
          get our final predictions. In this paper we describe some methods and techniques that 
          performs well in NumtaDB dataset.
